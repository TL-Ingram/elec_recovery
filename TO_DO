23/12/2022:
DONE - Clean script 
DONE - Make function to output the forecast for all specialties
DONE - Do it also for wl_52
Make graphs aesthetic
--- Change line size
--- angle dates
--- Check sizing of the graphs
--- Have each graph knit together for each speciality - e.g T&O full and 52 weeks ontop of each other.

DONE - Create table of outputs for wl mean size each year
--- Moved into function

DONE - Create table of outputs for when lower bound of wl_52 first reaches 0
--- Done for each spec

Do it for the whole waiting list too



Group by those specialties forecasted to increase and those to decrease
Read and think more about dynamic regression (adding predictors to the forecast; chp 9.1 Hynmann)
Then make it good to go into Qlik
Put all of this into Asana




Nice to do:
--- Merge graph and table output of mean size per year

09/01/2023 meeting
Add demand and capacity interactivity - cap = rate of taking people off
On 19th (Thurs) want to meet again with S&P to give them updates they've asked for:
  - Clearance dates that are NA to have % change from last position
  - 65 week waiters on top of 52
  - Overall WL with planned, deferred, unknown too
    - Check numbers with John/Patrick to ensure correct
How easy is this to apply to outpatients? Look into this and give a statment of how long expected to take by next Thurs


Make all outputs into a list inside the same function. Once this is done then have it join planned, def, unk, active together and plot simultaneously.
Maybe at around sim_results here I can make lists of each and then filter and plot from there?
Test it for only long waiters. Seeing some weird issue for whatever reason.


I think need to put all info into lists, and then merge each specific pair of dfs together (active_wl + active_forecast for Gastro, etc.) Then plot these. Then cowplot to put plots of the same spec all together.
Then create big full wl piece for the whole waiting list.

**********
In fact, do the whole wl first then do it by speciality? And table for when 52 and 65 week waiters cleared.
