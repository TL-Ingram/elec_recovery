23/12/2022:
DONE - Clean script 
DONE - Make function to output the forecast for all specialties
DONE - Do it also for wl_52
Make graphs aesthetic
--- Change line size
--- angle dates
--- Check sizing of the graphs
--- Have each graph knit together for each speciality - e.g T&O full and 52 weeks ontop of each other.

DONE - Create table of outputs for wl mean size each year
--- Moved into function

DONE - Create table of outputs for when lower bound of wl_52 first reaches 0
--- Done for each spec

Do it for the whole waiting list too



Group by those specialties forecasted to increase and those to decrease
Read and think more about dynamic regression (adding predictors to the forecast; chp 9.1 Hynmann)
Then make it good to go into Qlik
Put all of this into Asana

Nice to do:
--- Merge graph and table output of mean size per year
