Note taking from meeting

ETM - elective recovery modelling - asked by Silas to do some work.
  When will elective demand levels return to normal?
  New theatre in Leigh next year, capacity increase at Wrightington next year, so what does that mean for waiting list? What else do we need to do to get to an optimum waiting list time.
  
Non-scheduled work.
Work-force - we have availability to do more than we currently have at Wrightington. If we do have a lot.

Specialty level
85% theatre utilisation
18 week waiting list?







23/12/2022:
DONE - Clean script 
Make function to output the forecast for all specialties
Do it also for wl_52
Create table of outputs for when lower bound of wl_52 first reaches 0
Create table of outputs for wl mean size each year
Group by those specialties forecasted to increase and those to decrease
Do it for the whole waiting list too
Then make it good to go into Qlik
Put all of this into Asana
