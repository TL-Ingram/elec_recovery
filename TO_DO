DONE - Clean script 
DONE - Make function to output the forecast for all specialties
DONE - Do it also for wl_52
Make graphs aesthetic
--- Change line size
--- angle dates
--- Check sizing of the graphs
--- Have each graph knit together for each speciality - e.g T&O full and 52 weeks ontop of each other.

PARTIAL DONE - Create table of outputs for wl mean size each year
--- Need to move into function

Create table of outputs for when lower bound of wl_52 first reaches 0
Do it for the whole waiting list too
Group by those specialties forecasted to increase and those to decrease
Read and think more about dynamic regression (adding predictors to the forecast; chp 9.1 Hynmann)
Then make it good to go into Qlik
Put all of this into Asana
