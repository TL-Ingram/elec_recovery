Note taking from meeting

ETM - elective recovery modelling - asked by Silas to do some work.
  When will elective demand levels return to normal?
  New theatre in Leigh next year, capacity increase at Wrightington next year, so what does that mean for waiting list? What else do we need to do to get to an optimum waiting list time.
  
Non-scheduled work.
Work-force - we have availability to do more than we currently have at Wrightington. If we do have a lot.

Specialty level
85% theatre utilisation
18 week waiting list?
